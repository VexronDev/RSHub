# Getting Started 
**Remote Sensing Hub (RSHub)**

RSHub is a shared cloud computing platform for the remote sensing community to compute microwave scattering properties based on microwave electromagnetic scattering mechanisms.

**Supporting Scenarios:**

- Bare soil
- Vegetation-covered soil
- Snow-covered soil

**Steps to Run Your Code:**

1. [Register](/login) your account and get an access token.
2. Navigate to your scenario and check parameter lists.
3. Explore scenario demos for a quick start.

**Explore Scenario Demos:**

- A Simple Soil Scenario
- Multi-layer Vegetation Scenario
- Multi-layer Snow Scenario
