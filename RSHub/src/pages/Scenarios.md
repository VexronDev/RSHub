## Vegetation-covered soil
### 1. Vegetation Passive Radiative Model

This model estimates the brightness temperature of vegetation covered land surfaces based on the radiative transfer theory. It incorporates the multiple scattering effects both within the vegetation layer and in the vegetation-soil scattering interactions. The model enables heterogeneous vertical distribution of vegetation components for better characterization of complex vegetation scenarios including mixed tree species in various growth stages. This platform allows users to define the vertical structure of vegetation to fit their own research objectives, while providing a reliable tool for exploring its impact on the associated microwave emission.
