# DMRT-QMS 
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="description" label="Model Description">
    DMRT-QMS is a physical scattering model that is widely adopted for active and passive microwave modeling of snowpacks based on the dense media radiative transfer theory (DMRT). The DMRT theory predicts the microwave intensity scattering, absorption, and propagation in a dense random media. In DMRT-QCA, the approach of quasi-crystal approximation (QCA) is applied to characterize snow scattering characteristics by solving the multiple scattering of densely packed sticky spheres with moderate grain sizes. The QCA approach provides a broad range of frequency-, size-, and density- dependent scattering characteristics with moderate forward scattering patterns. The size of the snow grains, the stickiness of the snow, the snow density or equivalently the ice volume fraction, and the temperature of the snow all affect these characteristics. In DMRT-QMS, the discrete ordinate method with eigenvalue analysis is used to solve the radiative transfer equation with multiple scattering effects among ice particles. DMRT-QMS computes both the Tbs and the backscattering coefficients of a snowpack.
